    <h1>How do I see the differences between HTML and CSS?</h1>
    <p>
      1. What is the difference between the usage of
      <strong>HTML and CSS?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is used to create the actual content of the page, such as written
      text, and CSS is responsible for the design or style of the website,
      including the layout, visual effects and background color.
    </p>
    <p>2. What is the newest version of <strong>HTML?</strong></p>
    <p>
      HTML5 is the latest major version of HTML. It was officially finalized in
      October 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. What are the top five most used <strong>HTML5 elements</strong> ? If
      not sure, make a guess.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>DOCTYPE Declaration</li>
      <li>Semantics</li>
      <li>script and link</li>
      <li>input types and forms</li>
      <li>ETC</li>
    </ol>

    <p>4. Have you checked out the <strong>HTML5 cheatsheet?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Yes, I have checked the
      <a href="https://www.wpkube.com/html5-cheat-sheet/">HTML5 cheatsheet.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      5. What is the difference between
      <strong>semantic and non-semantic</strong> elements?
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-semantic elements in HTML don't give any idea other than their type.
      For example, &lt; p &gt; only gives us the idea of paragraph text. But
      semantic elements tell us what they are and how they relate to the
      webpage. For example, &lt; header &gt; indicates the place where the page
      begins and may contain some navigation links. &lt; article &gt; suggests a
      form, post, or newspaper article on the page.
    </p>
    <p>6. Why do we prefer using <strong>semantic elements?</strong></p>
    <p>
      semantic elements tell us what they are and how they relate to the
      webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Do all <strong>browsers support</strong> all of the newest HTML / CSS
      elements?
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, it should work. There is a website called "Can I use" provides
      up-to-date browser support tables for support of front-end web
      technologies on desktop and mobile web browsers.
    </p>

    <p>
      8. Test the following elements on
      <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I Use:</a>
      <code class="tags">svg</code>, <code class="tags red">nav</code>,
      <code class="tags red">code</code>, <code class="tags red">form</code>,
      <code class="tags">datalist</code> Which browser version supports them and
      which do not?
